## Note
The layout was implemented using React with Bootstrap, following a component-based approach. Created a reusable layout component and integrated it across all pages using react-router-dom for smooth navigation. Responsiveness was ensured using Bootstrap’s grid system to maintain consistent behavior across devices.

## Project Summary

## Layout Approach
