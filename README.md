## Layout Approach
The layout was built using React and Tailwind CSS (or mention the stack you used). Component-based structure with reusable layout blocks.

## Responsiveness
Designed with mobile-first principles. Breakpoints were handled using Tailwind's utility classes to ensure the layout adapts well on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## Project Structure
- `/src/components` – Reusable UI elements
- `/src/pages` – Screens for layout rendering
- `/public` – Static assets

## How to Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VigneshHere/E-commerce_Project/tree/main
cd yourrepo
npm install
npm run dev
