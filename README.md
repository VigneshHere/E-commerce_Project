## Project Summary
This project is a frontend-only E-Commerce UI developed using React, Bootstrap, and React Router DOM. The goal was to build and demonstrate key e-commerce pages with navigation and responsiveness.

## Layout Approach
The layout was built using React and Bootstrap CSS. Component-based structure with reusable layout blocks.

## Responsiveness
Designed with mobile-first principles. Breakpoints were handled using Bootstrap's utility classes to ensure the layout adapts well on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
